Autoscaling in Kubernetes based on a readiness probe isn't directly supported. However, you can achieve autoscaling using custom metrics, which can be related to your readiness probe. Here's an approach you can take:

1. **Create a readiness probe in your application**
   
   Add a readiness probe to your application code to determine if it's ready to serve traffic. For example, you can use an HTTP endpoint that returns a 200 status code when ready and a non-200 status code when not ready.

2. **Expose custom metrics**
   
   Modify your application to expose custom metrics related to the readiness probe, such as the total number of ready instances or percentage of ready instances. You can use a library like Prometheus client to expose these metrics in a format that's easy to scrape.

3. **Deploy Prometheus to scrape custom metrics**

   Deploy Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster and configure it to scrape your application's custom metrics. Follow the `Prometheus documentation <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/>`_ for details.

4. **Deploy kube-state-metrics (if not already deployed)**

   Deploy kube-state-metrics to expose Kubernetes objects' metrics to Prometheus. Follow the instructions on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics>`_.

5. **Deploy Prometheus Adapter**

   Deploy the Prometheus Adapter to expose custom metrics from Prometheus as external metrics for the Kubernetes API. Follow the instructions on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter>`_.

6. **Configure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to use custom metrics**
   
   Create an HPA configuration that uses custom metrics related to your readiness probe. For example::

      .. code-block:: yaml

         apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
         kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
         metadata:
           name: my-app-hpa
         spec:
           scaleTargetRef:
             apiVersion: apps/v1
             kind: Deployment
             name: my-app
           minReplicas: 1
           maxReplicas: 10
           metrics:
           - type: Pods
             pods:
               metric:
                 name: my_readiness_metric
               target:
                 type: AverageValue
                 averageValue: 100

   Replace ``my_readiness_metric`` with your custom metric name. Adjust ``minReplicas``, ``maxReplicas``, and ``averageValue`` according to your needs.

7. **Apply the HPA configuration**

   Run ``kubectl apply -f hpa.yaml`` to apply the HPA configuration.

This setup will make Kubernetes autoscale your application based on the custom metric derived from your readiness probe. Note that this is an indirect method, and you might need to adjust the scaling thresholds according to your specific use case.
